  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>
    Yorkshire puddings are a traditional British side dish, often served alongside
    a Sunday roast or Christmas dinner.
  </p>

  <p><em>Makes 12 servings</em></p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>2 Eggs</li>

    <li>1 cup Milk</li>

    <li>1 cup Flour</li>

    <li>2 tbsp butter (or ~1 cup beef drippings)</li>

    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Preheat an oven to 400° F.</li>

    <li>Mix the eggs, flour, milk, and salt together in a bowl.</li>

    <li>
      Ideally, allow the batter to rest overnight in the refrigerator, then
      bring back to room temperature before proceeding. Doing this will help
      the puddings to rise.
    </li>

    <li>
      Evenly divide the butter or beef drippings into the cups of a 12-cup
      muffin tin. Place the tin in the oven until the fat is sizzling and smoking,
      about 15 minutes.
    </li>

    <li>
      Quickly pour the batter into the muffin cups. It should begin sizzling
      right away. Move quickly to prevent loss of heat.
    </li>

    <li>
      Bake for 8 minutes. Reduce heat to 350° F, and bake for another 20 minutes.
    </li>
  </ol>
